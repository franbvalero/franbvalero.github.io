I am an Applied Scientist specializing in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, currently based in Barcelona, Spain. I hold a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Digital Imaging from the <a href="https://www.upv.es/index-en.html">Polytechnic University of Valencia</a>., and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from the <a href="https://www.ua.es/en/">University of Alicante</a>. 

My experience includes working at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> as an Applied Scientist where I focused on several community feedback (reviews and Q&A) projects to inform customer purchase decisions. Prior to that, I gained valuable experience as an R&D Intern at <a href="https://research.deezer.com/">Deezer</a>, where I worked on podcast topic modeling, and as an ML/NLP Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/">Kustomer</a>, where I enhanced intent capabilities in CRM chats. My foundation in this field is further supported by my research experience at the <a href="https://www.ua.es/en/">University of Alicante</a>, where I worked on machine translation and text sequence labeling. Â  

I also enjoy traveling and sports.
