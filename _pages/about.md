I am an AI Engineer at <a href="https://supersonik.ai"> Supersonik </a> where we transform SaaS sales by building AI agents that run interactive and live product demos 24/7.

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon. I focused on informing customer purchase decisions by applying NLP, ML, and LLMs to customer feedback data. We built the first AI-generated product insights from customer reviews in e-commerce (see Amazon blog posts <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-ai/amazon-improves-customer-reviews-with-generative-ai"> 1 </a> and <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-ai-generated-review-highlights"> 2</a>).

I am also the core builder of the <a href="https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data"> ESCI Benchmark dataset </a>.
